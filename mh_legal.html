		<div>Role of Medical RecommendationA psychiatrist is a doctor that specialises in the assessment and treatment of people who are experiencing mental ill-health. They can offer a mental health diagnosis and give an opinion on whether or not the patient needs to be in hospital to access treatment for their mental ill-health.
Before anyone can be detained in the community under the Mental Health Act, there must generally be two Medical Recommendations confirming assessment or treatment in hospital is needed.​​​
At least one must be from a Section 12 approved doctor, usually a psychiatrist or medical doctor with additional MH training.​
Where there is no doctor with previous acquaintance available, then both doctors must be Section 12 approved.
</div>
		<div>The Mental Health Act requires the Aprroved Mental Health Practitioner to inform (S2) or consult (S3) with the nearest relative. Who the nearest relative is can take some working out. There is a hierarchy in Section 26 MHA. In general, where relatives are on the same level, for example mother or father, then it would be the eldest of the two. P can challenge who is suitable to be NR and AMHPs can apply to a court to have a relative displaced if not acting in the best interests of the patient under Section 29.</div>
		<div>Role of Community ServicesCommunity Mental Health Teams, Crisis Teams and Street Triage could all have roles to play.​​
They may have previous knowledge of P, their medical history, current treatment regime, any history or risk to self or others. They can outline support available to P if they remain in the community.​​​
Community teams often have a range of professionals, such as Community Psychiatric Nurses (CPNs), Social Workers, Support Workers, Occupational Therapist and Psychologists.​
Patients known to CMHT often have a psychiatrist who knows P and can advise on their treatment
AMHP can delegate the power to convey to Ambulance staff and others. (Section 6 MHA, COP 17.13)​
</div>
		<div>The family should be consulted on the patient's presentation and any recent changes, risk and available informal support. The family are an excellent source of information on how the patient is presenting and how this presentation may have changed over recent days. Family can help build rapport with the patient. This is also a vert stressful and distressing time for families, where possible consider support for families at scene.</div>
		<div>Role of Medical Recommendation
A General Practitioner (GP) is a medical doctor who can be asked to give a medical recommendation on one of two grounds. Either, the GP has previous acquaintance with the patient (ie knows them and can assess if their presentation is different to how they present generally) or have attended Section 12 training. This is specialist training on the assessment of people under the Mental Health Act.</div>
		<div>Role of the Approved Mental Health Practitioner (AMHP)They must decide if an assessment is needed or offer alternatives. Assessment should be the last resort.
The AMHP who makes the application for detention if the criteria are met. A Nearest Relative can also make the application but this is rare for good reason.​
The AMHP is usually an experienced Social Worker, though a Nurse, OT or Psychologist could also do the training and practice. Not all social workers are AMHPs.​
AMHPs work on behalf of the Local Authority and give a different perspective to the medical model.​
They have up to 14 days to arrange a detention if required but primarily, their role is to avoid admission if safe to do so.​
AMHPs can delegate some of their powers to others, (ie Ambulance)
What does the AMHP do?Firstly, they must attempt to interview P in 'a suitable manner'.​
They must inform or consult the Nearest Relative, depending on which section they choose.​
They must have two valid medical recommendations. (S4 exception)​
They must consider if P can be safely supported to remain in the community.​
They must satisfy themselves that the detention criteria are met before they can make an application.​
They must arrange conveyance once a hospital destination has been agreed and conveyance risk assessment carried out. Ambulance conveyance is the preferred method. (Code of Practice 17.12)</div>

		<div>The person/patient is central to the process and must be consulted to gain their views on what support they need and the best way to provide that support. They must be informed of their rights.​</div>
		<div>Role of Ambulance StaffThe main role of ambulance staff is to safely and humanely convey the patient to the hospital named on the application.​
Why use an ambulance? - MHA COP states that in choosing the method of conveyance, AMHPs must consider 'the impact that any particular method of conveyancing the patient will have on the patient's relationship with the community to which they return'.​​
If P is violent/ presents a significant risk of absconding, Police can assist ambulance staff or can transport P in a Police vehicle with assistance from the 'highest qualified' member of staff with any necessary equipment and the ambulance following on behind (COP 17.16-17).​​
Sedated patients must be accompanied by a health professional. (COP 17.7)
AMHP can delegate the power to convey to Ambulance staff and others. (Section 6 MHA, COP 17.13)​
Once the delegation has been accepted, the ambulance crew have 'the powers of a constable' (S137 MHA). This means the crew can 'act in their own right' and can use restraint to prevent P absconding/harming self or others (COP 17.18).​
'Where the applicant (eg AMHP) is not travelling in the same vehicle as the patient, the application form and medical recommendations should be given to the person authorised (eg ambulance crew)to transport the patient...' (COP 17.21)Conveyane advice for Ambulance crewFamiliarise yourself with the Joint Local Policy around MHA conveyance.​​
Consult and fully cooperate with the AMHP around the safety of using an ambulance for conveying an unwilling patient.​​
Ensure the receiving hospital are aware you are coming and where possible give an ETA.​​
Consider whether someone can accompany P safely or will this escalate the risks.​​
Ensure you have a copy of the application & Medical Recommendations or at least a form delegating the authority to convey from the AMHP.​​
Ensure you hand all paperwork over to the receiving hospital staff.</div>
